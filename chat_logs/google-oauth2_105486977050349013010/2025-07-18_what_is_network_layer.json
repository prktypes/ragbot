It determines an appropriate path through the network using its protocol, such as IP (Internet Protocol), and encapsulates segments from the transport layer into packets before sending them to the nearest router. In larger networks, routing protocols like OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) might be used for more robust failover and recovery options."}], "user_id": "google-oauth2|105486977050349013010", "uploaded_filename": "cn.pdf"}
